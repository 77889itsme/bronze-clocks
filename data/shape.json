    "content": "A jue is used to serve warm wine during rituals. Its particular shape—flared, pointed, triangular legs; ovoid body; long curved spout counterbalanced with a pointed flange; and two columnar protrusions—makes jue one of the most easily identifiable ancient Chinese bronze and pottery vessel forms. In later periods, jue were still made for ritual use and Qing-dynasty (1644–1912); examples often have elongated legs.",
